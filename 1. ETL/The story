  After some digging I thought that I will start by first just trying to extract some basic data from an endpoint. Randomly, I chose 
coindesk API. The result was one price update per minute (1.coindesk_data_extraction.py). Didn't read this API's documentation thoroughly,
just started extracting every second, but quickly realized it's nonsense that way. I need an API that provides me price update every second,
so I thought let's use something more robust... what other than binance APIs? 
  I came upon this endpoint: https://api.binance.com/api/v3/ticker/price?symbol=BTCUSDT. Now this seamed to work after some work and
debugging. But, this is very important, making a request to this endpoint will not give us time data! Note that coindesk API did, but not 
with satisfiing precision. 
  I can use https://api.binance.com/api/v3/time at once with price data endpoint and continue on with making the complete ETL using 
concurrent.futures module to execute the two extractions concurrently (2.concurrent_binance_extraction.py), but there will be of course a 
difference in server time between my two extractions (3.time_difference.py), and this bothers me... I want high level of precision,so I need to figure out
a way already here at the very beggining, to eliminate this time difference efficiently, after all we cannot allow propagation of error 
to kick in.
