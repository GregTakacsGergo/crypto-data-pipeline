  After some digging I thought that I will start by first just trying to extract some basic data from an endpoint. Randomly, I chose 
coindesk API. The result was one price update per minute (1.coindesk_data_extraction.py). Didn't read this API's documentation thoroughly, just started 
extracting every second, but quickly realized it's nonsense that way. I need an API that provides me price update every second, so I
thought let's use something more robust... what other than binance APIs? 
  I came upon this endpoint: https://api.binance.com/api/v3/ticker/price?symbol=BTCUSDT. Now this seamed to work after some work and d
debugging. ( )
