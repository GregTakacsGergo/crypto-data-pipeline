Thank you for showing up here in this repo, please follow my journey of developing this project!
I'd like to present you my skills that are essential to start a data science or engineer carrier. 
I will take you through from my first ideas, first attempts, to the more complex methods, and more in depth solutions to my ever growing demand for quality, and precision.
